## Real-Life Example

Say you're writing a basic finance app or a school learning tool — this calculator could be part of it.
Or maybe you're just learning Python and want to practice how loops and functions work.
It’s a great little exercise to build up from!

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more operations (like square root or exponents)

- Add input validation to prevent errors if someone enters a letter

- Make a GUI version using Tkinter or a web version with Flask
