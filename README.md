To make things more intresting, I am going to exclusively write and push every code I write using an Ubuntu 20.04 CLI I installed on my android phone. In summary, I'm going to write, test and push every code using just my phone, including this README file.

## Why am I doing this?

To prove to myself that I can solve problems from anywhere with any device and to also make sure I don't forget my fundamental training.

Here goes nothing..
